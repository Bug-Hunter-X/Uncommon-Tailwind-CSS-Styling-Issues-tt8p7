// This is a simple Tailwind CSS component that renders a button.
<button class="bg-blue-500 hover:bg-blue-700 text-white font-bold py-2 px-4 rounded">
  Click Me
</button>
```

This component uses Tailwind CSS classes to style the button. However, if you run into an issue where the button is not styled correctly, it may be due to several reasons, such as incorrect Tailwind CSS configuration, missing or conflicting CSS rules, or an issue with the build process.  The issue can manifest in subtle ways, such as unexpected spacing, color inconsistencies, or elements not rendering at all.
