// Check Tailwind Configuration
// Ensure that the Tailwind CSS configuration file (tailwind.config.js) is correctly set up and that the content array includes the paths to your CSS files.
// Check for conflicting styles or CSS specificity
//  Use browser developer tools to inspect the element and ensure that no conflicting styles or higher specificity rules override Tailwind's styles.
// Clear cache and restart the build process
// Sometimes clearing your browser cache and restarting your build process can solve unexpected styling issues.
// Verify Build Process
//  Make sure your build process correctly includes the generated Tailwind CSS styles.
//Consider using PurgeCSS or similar tool
// This helps remove unused Tailwind classes which improves performance and reduces the size of your CSS bundle and can also solve conflict issues.
// Add !important in a last resort
//  only use as a last resort to override other styles. It's important to understand the implications of using !important.
